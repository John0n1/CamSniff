# CamSniff Security Configuration Guide

This document outlines security considerations and best practices for CamSniff deployment.

## Security Features

### Input Validation
- All network inputs are validated using regex patterns
- CIDR notation validation for subnet parameters
- Input sanitization to prevent command injection
- Parameter length limits to prevent buffer overflows

### Privilege Management
- Root privileges required only for network scanning operations
- Temporary file cleanup with secure permissions
- Process isolation for scanning operations
- Background process management with PID tracking

### Credential Security
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Secure credential file handling with proper permissions
- Credential rotation recommendations
- Encrypted credential storage support

### Network Security
- Rate limiting for scanning operations
- Stealth mode for reduced network footprint
- Configurable timeouts to prevent hanging connections
- SSL/TLS verification for external connections

## Configuration Security

### File Permissions
```bash
# Recommended file permissions
chmod 600 /etc/camsniff/camcfg.json
chmod 700 /var/log/camsniff/
chmod 755 /usr/share/camsniff/
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Security-focused environment variables
export CAMSNIFF_LOG_LEVEL=WARN
export CAMSNIFF_STEALTH_MODE=1
export CAMSNIFF_MAX_THREADS=10
export CAMSNIFF_TIMEOUT=5
```

### Secure Configuration Example
```json
{
  "sleep_seconds": 60,
  "nmap_ports": "80,443,554,8080",
  "masscan_rate": 1000,
  "hydra_rate": 4,
  "max_streams": 2,
  "enable_iot_enumeration": false,
  "enable_pcap_capture": false,
  "enable_wifi_scan": false,
  "enable_ble_scan": false,
  "enable_zigbee_zwave_scan": false,
  "stealth_mode": true,
  "enable_nmap_vuln": false,
  "enable_brute_force": false
}
```

## Deployment Security

### Network Isolation
- Deploy in isolated network segments
- Use VPN for remote access
- Implement network monitoring
- Log all scanning activities

### System Hardening
- Regular security updates
- Minimal service installation
- Firewall configuration
- Intrusion detection systems

### Monitoring & Alerting
- Real-time log monitoring
- Anomaly detection
- Security event correlation
- Incident response procedures

## Compliance Considerations

### Legal Requirements
- Obtain explicit permission before scanning
- Comply with local and international laws
- Document all scanning activities
- Implement data retention policies

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive scan results
- Secure log file storage
- Regular data cleanup
- Access control implementation

### Audit Requirements
- Comprehensive activity logging
- Tamper-evident log storage
- Regular security assessments
- Compliance reporting

## Incident Response

### Detection
- Monitor for unusual network activity
- Alert on failed authentication attempts
- Track scanning anomalies
- Log security events

### Response
- Immediate containment procedures
- Evidence preservation
- Stakeholder notification
- Recovery procedures

## Security Updates

### Vulnerability Management
- Regular dependency updates
- Security patch management
- Vulnerability scanning
- Risk assessment procedures

### Update Process
1. Monitor security advisories
2. Test updates in isolated environment
3. Deploy updates during maintenance windows
4. Verify system functionality post-update

## Contact Information
