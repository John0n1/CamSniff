CamSniff on Debian
==================

CamSniff orchestrates several network scanners and packet capture utilities. On
Debian systems the binary is shipped without elevated privileges; interactive
runs should be executed with `sudo camsniff` or equivalent capabilities so that
Masscan and TShark integrations succeed.  See `/usr/share/doc/camsniff/` for
packaged guides on mode configuration and extending the data dictionaries.

A lightweight smoke autopkgtest is provided to ensure the command line
interface remains available.  More invasive network tests are intentionally
omitted to keep CI farm runs self-contained.
