Description: Mode-aware reconnaissance toolkit for IP cameras
 CamSniff is a mode-aware, data-driven reconnaissance toolkit focused on
 discovering IP cameras and related streaming or telemetry endpoints on
 local networks. It coordinates active scanning (Nmap with optional
 Masscan), passive discovery (Avahi/mDNS), and targeted packet captures
 (TShark) to build unified host profiles.
