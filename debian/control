Description: Camera Reconnaissance Tool
 CamSniff is a powerful reconnaissance tool designed for security professionals
 and researchers. It specializes in identifying and analyzing IP cameras and 
 other network devices, providing deep insights into their configuration and
 vulnerabilities.
 .
 Features include:
  * Network device discovery and enumeration
  * IP camera detection and analysis
  * RTSP stream identification and testing
  * CVE vulnerability checking
  * SNMP community enumeration
  * Web interface discovery and fuzzing
  * Reporting and logging
 .
 This tool is intended for educational and research purposes only.

 NOTE: Most runtime tools (nmap, masscan, hydra, ffmpeg, tshark, curl, jq, etc.)
 are intentionally not hard dependencies. The launcher performs runtime
 detection and can install missing components (with confirmation) on the first
 privileged execution.
