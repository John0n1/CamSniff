Description: Automated IP camera reconnaissance and credential audit toolkit
 CamSniff orchestrates multi-stage discovery of IP cameras on a local
 network. It coordinates nmap RTSP enumeration, optional masscan sweeps,
 Avahi/mDNS discovery, and tshark traffic captures, then correlates the
 findings with a vendor knowledge base. Finally, CamSniff attempts HTTP
 snapshots and RTSP still captures using curated default credentials to
 surface misconfigured surveillance systems.
