## Introduction

**CamSniff** is a powerful reconnaissance tool designed for security professionals and researchers. It specializes in identifying and analyzing IP cameras and other network devices, providing deep insights into their configuration and vulnerabilities.

---

## Features

- **Network Scanning**  
  Identify active devices using tools like `fping`, `arp-scan`, `masscan`, `nmap`, `onesixtyone`, and more.

- **Protocol Support**  
  Scan and analyze RTSP, HTTP, CoAP, RTMP, and HLS protocols.

- **Brute-Forcing**  
  - Credentials brute-forcing with `hydra` and `medusa`.
  - Directory brute-forcing with `gobuster`.

- **Vulnerability Analysis**  
  Automated checks for known CVEs based on device information.

- **AI-Based Insights**  
  Detect IR spots and other patterns in camera streams using OpenCV.

- **Stream Management**  
  Display camera streams in a mosaic view using `ffmpeg` and `ffplay`.

- **Plugin Support**  
  Extend functionality with custom Bash or Python scripts in the `plugins` directory.

---

## Requirements

CamSniff is designed for Linux systems, especially Debian-based distributions (e.g., Ubuntu). All dependencies are installed automatically when you run the script.

**Core Tools:**  
`bash`, `curl`, `jq`, `nc`, `ffmpeg`, `ffplay`

**Network Tools:**  
`fping`, `masscan`, `nmap`, `hydra`, `tcpdump`, `tshark`, `arp-scan`

**Python:**  
`python3`, `python3-venv`, `python3-pip`, `opencv-python`

**Other Tools:**  
`gobuster`, `medusa`, `onesixtyone`, `coap-client`, `rtmpdump`

## Installation

### Recommended (DEB Package)

Download and install the latest DEB package from the [releases page](https://github.com/John0n1/CamSniff/releases/latest) for easy installation and updates.

### Manual (From Source)

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/John0n1/CamSniff.git
    cd CamSniff
    ```

2. Make the scripts executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x *.sh
    ```

3. Run the launcher:
    ```bash
    sudo ./camsniff.sh
    ```

---

## Usage

1. **Launch the Tool**  
   Run `camsniff.sh` to start. An introduction will appear and you‚Äôll be prompted to begin scanning.

2. **Scanning**  
   - Scan your network for devices and identify cameras.
   - Analyze and display camera streams in a mosaic view.

3. **Plugins**  
   - Extend functionality by adding `.sh` or `.py` scripts to the `plugins` directory.

4. **Logs**  
   - All logs are stored in `.log` files for debugging and analysis.

---

## Configuration

CamSniff uses the `camcfg.json` file for scanning parameters. Example:

```json
{
  "sleep_seconds": 45,
  "nmap_ports": "1-65535",
  "masscan_rate": 20000,
  "hydra_rate": 16,
  "max_streams": 4,
  "cve_db": "/usr/share/cve/cve-2025.json",
  "dynamic_rtsp_url": "https://github.com/CamioCam/rtsp/blob/master/cameras/paths.csv",
  "dirb_wordlist": "/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt",
  "snmp_communities": ["public", "private", "camera", "admin"],
  "medusa_threads": 8
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Dependencies:**  
  The tool will try to auto-install missing dependencies. Run as root (`sudo`) to allow installations.

- **RTSP Paths Not Found:**  
  Ensure `dynamic_rtsp_url` in `camcfg.json` points to a valid RTSP paths CSV.

- **Permission Issues:**  
  Always run as root to ensure necessary permissions for network scanning and dependency installation.
