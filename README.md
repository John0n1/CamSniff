## Introduction

**CamSniff** is a sophisticated reconnaissance and analysis tool designed for IP cameras and associated IoT devices. It efficiently discovers devices, enumerates services, identifies common camera endpoints, captures snapshots for lightweight AI-driven analysis, and highlights potential vulnerabilities. The integrated Web UI provides real-time visualization of results, including camera feeds, network topology, maps, and alerts.

---

## Features

- **Camera Identification**: Advanced fingerprinting with brand-specific hints (e.g., Hikvision, Dahua, Axis, Vivotek, Foscam, and more).
- **Network Scanning**: Utilizes tools such as `fping`, `arp-scan`, `masscan`, `nmap`, `onesixtyone`, and others for  scanning.
- **Protocols**: Supports RTSP, HTTP/MJPEG/HLS, CoAP, RTMP, and MQTT protocols.
- **IoT Enumeration**: Includes UPnP/SSDP, mDNS, BLE scanning, Zigbee/Z-Wave adapter detection, WiFi OUI hints, and topology snapshots.
- **Web Dashboard**: A lightweight Flask-based UI for viewing cameras, topology, maps, and alerts, complete with live screenshots and timelines.
- **Reporting**: Generates text and JSON summaries, alerts logs, and optional Nmap vulnerability scan outputs.
- **Credentials & Brute Force**: Employs Hydra/Medusa combinations with curated username/password lists; includes Gobuster for directory scanning.
- **AI Snapshot Analysis**: Applies IR spot detection, motion, and brightness heuristics using OpenCV on captured frames.
- **Mosaic View**: Supports multi-camera layouts with basic overlays.
- **Automation**: Features auto/quiet modes, target subnet selection, and plugin hooks for streamlined operations.

## Requirements

CamSniff is optimized for Linux environments, with testing focused on Debian-based distributions such as Kali, Parrot, and Ubuntu. The script automatically installs required tools during the initial run when executed with root privileges.

## Installation

### Recommended (DEB Package)

Download and install the latest DEB package from the [releases page](https://github.com/John0n1/CamSniff/releases/latest):

```bash
sudo apt install -y ./camsniff*.deb 
```
or

```bash
gdebi ./camsniff_1.0.2_all.deb
```
This installation places the launcher at `/usr/bin/camsniff` and the default configuration at `/etc/camsniff/camcfg.json`.

### Manual (From Source)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/John0n1/CamSniff.git
   cd CamSniff
   ```

2. Make the scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x *.sh
   ```

3. Run the launcher:
   ```bash
   sudo ./camsniff.sh
   ```

---

## Usage

Launch the main script `camsniff.sh` with root privileges to enter interactive mode:

```bash
sudo ./camsniff.sh
```

If installed via the DEB package, use the following command:

```bash
sudo camsniff
```

### Optional Web Dashboard

Initiate the lightweight dashboard during or after scans to visualize cameras, maps, and alerts:

```bash
./webui.sh
```

This launches a Flask server accessible at `http://localhost:8088` (customizable via `CAMSNIFF_WEB_PORT`). It automatically loads the latest output folder from `./output/`.

## Output and Reporting

CamSniff 1.0.2 now delivers a improved, , structured outputs and reports:

```bash
./webui.sh
```

This launches a Flask server accessible at `http://localhost:8088` (customizable via `CAMSNIFF_WEB_PORT`). It automatically loads the latest output folder from `./output/`.

## Output and Reporting

CamSniff 1.0.2 now delivers a improved, , structured outputs and reports:

```

**Key Features:**
- **Real-time CVE data**: Fetches the latest vulnerability information from [CVEProject/cvelistV5](https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5)
- **Smart caching**: Results are cached locally for 24 hours to improve performance
- **Device-specific searches**: Automatically searches for CVEs related to detected camera brands (Hikvision, Dahua, Axis, etc.)
- **Structured CVE data**: Parses official CVE JSON format for accurate vulnerability information

### Camera Information
Each discovered camera is logged with:
- IP address and port
- Protocol type (RTSP, HTTP, etc.)
- Device manufacturer (when detectable)
- Credentials used (if any)
- AI analysis results (IR detection, motion areas, brightness)

### Command Line Options
```bash
sudo ./camsniff.sh [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -y, --yes     Skip confirmation prompts
  -q, --quiet   Reduce output verbosity
  -a, --auto    Full automation mode (skip all prompts)
  -t, --target  Specify target subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
  -h, --help    Show this help message
```

## Configuration

CamSniff loads its configuration from `camcfg.json` (prioritizing `/etc/camsniff/camcfg.json` if installed). Below is an example with default settings (all features enabled in version 1.0.2):

**Everything has a default value but can be customized:**

```json
{
  "sleep_seconds": 45,
  "nmap_ports": "1-65535",
  "masscan_rate": 20000,
  "hydra_rate": 16,
  "max_streams": 4,
  "cve_github_repo": "https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5/tree/0c81b12af2cabcadb83f312d4d81dc99008235c9/cves/",
  "cve_cache_dir": "/tmp/cve_cache",
  "cve_current_year": "2025",
  "dynamic_rtsp_url": "https://github.com/John0n1/CamSniff/blob/4d682edf7b4512562d24ccdf863332952637094d/data/rtsp_paths.csv",
  "dirb_wordlist": "/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt",
  "password_wordlist": "data/passwords.txt", 
  "username_wordlist": "data/usernames.txt", 
  "snmp_communities": ["public", "private", "camera", "admin", "cam", "cisco", "default", "guest", "test"], //
  "medusa_threads": 8, 
  "enable_iot_enumeration": true,
  "enable_pcap_capture": true,
  "enable_wifi_scan": true,
  "enable_ble_scan": true,
  "enable_zigbee_zwave_scan": true,
  "stealth_mode": true,
  "enable_nmap_vuln": true
}
```

**Notes:**
- `stealth_mode`: Introduces jitter to sleep intervals for a less predictable scanning pattern.
- `enable_nmap_vuln`: Executes `nmap --script vuln` on discovered hosts (may increase scan duration but provides deeper insights).
- Wireless/BLE/Zigbee features require compatible hardware and permissions; disable them if not applicable.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Dependencies:** The tool auto-installs dependencies on first run; ensure execution with `sudo`.
- **RTSP Paths Not Found:** Verify that `dynamic_rtsp_url` references a valid CSV/TSV; a built-in minimal list serves as a fallback.
- **Permission Issues:** Root privileges are required for scanning, dependency installation, and packet capture (pcap).
- **Non-TTY Output/CI:** Use `NO_ANIM=1` to disable animations in non-interactive environments.
- **IoT Enumeration:** BLE and Zigbee/Z-Wave require hardware/driver support; disable relevant flags if unavailable.
- **Error Messages:** Inspect `output/*/logs/` and `alerts.log` for detailed diagnostics and context.
