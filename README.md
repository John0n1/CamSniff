## Introduction

**CamSniff** is a powerful reconnaissance tool designed for security professionals and researchers. It specializes in identifying and analyzing IP cameras and other network devices, providing deep insights into their configuration and vulnerabilities.

---

## Features

- **Enhanced Camera Identification**  
  Advanced fingerprinting of IP cameras with brand detection (Hikvision, Dahua, Axis, etc.)

- **Network Scanning**  
  Identify active devices using tools like `fping`, `arp-scan`, `masscan`, `nmap`, `onesixtyone`, and more.

- **Protocol Support**  
  Scan and analyze RTSP, HTTP, CoAP, RTMP, and HLS protocols with enhanced detection methods.

- **Structured Output & Reporting**  
  - JSON and text-based summary reports
  - Organized output directories with logs, screenshots, and analysis
  - Real-time camera discovery tracking

- **Brute-Forcing**  
  - Credentials brute-forcing with `hydra` and `medusa`.
  - Directory brute-forcing with `gobuster`.

- **Vulnerability Analysis**  
  Automated checks for known CVEs based on device information.

- **Enhanced AI-Based Insights**  
  - Detect IR spots and motion areas in camera streams using OpenCV
  - Brightness analysis for night vision detection
  - Comprehensive image analysis with structured output

- **Advanced Stream Management**  
  - Enhanced mosaic view with camera information overlay
  - Optimal grid layouts for multiple cameras
  - Real-time camera feed management

- **Automation & Command Line Options**  
  - Full automation mode for unattended scanning
  - Custom target subnet specification
  - Quiet mode and skip prompts options

- **Plugin Support**  
  Extend functionality with custom Bash or Python scripts in the `plugins` directory.

---

## Requirements

CamSniff is designed for Linux systems, especially Debian-based distributions (e.g., Kali Linux). All dependencies are installed automatically when you run the script.

The following tools and libaries make up the core functionality of CamSniff. A big thanks to the developers of these tools for their contributions to the open-source community.

**Core Tools:**  
`bash`, `curl`, `jq`, `nc`, `ffmpeg`, `ffplay`

**Network Tools:**  
`fping`, `masscan`, `nmap`, `hydra`, `tcpdump`, `tshark`, `arp-scan`

**Python:**  
`python3`, `python3-venv`, `python3-pip`, `opencv-python`

**Other Tools:**  
`gobuster`, `medusa`, `onesixtyone`, `coap-client`, `rtmpdump`

## Installation

### Recommended (DEB Package)

Download and install the latest DEB package from the [releases page](https://github.com/John0n1/CamSniff/releases/latest) for easy installation and updates.

### Manual (From Source)

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/John0n1/CamSniff.git
    cd CamSniff
    ```

2. Make the scripts executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x *.sh
    ```

3. Run the launcher:
    ```bash
    sudo ./camsniff.sh
    ```

---

## Usage

Simply run the main script "`camsniff.sh`" with root privileges to start the interactive mode:

```bash
sudo ./camsniff.sh
```
If you install the DEB package, you can use the command:

```bash
sudo camsniff
```

## Enhanced Output and Reporting

CamSniff 1.0.1 now provides comprehensive structured output and reporting:

### Output Directory Structure
```
/tmp/camsniff_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/           # Scan logs and debug information
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screenshots/    # Camera snapshots with AI analysis
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ reports/        # Summary reports and structured data
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt    # Human-readable summary
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json   # Machine-readable summary
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cameras.json                    # Detailed camera information
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ analysis_IP.json               # Per-camera AI analysis
```
**Key Features:**
- **Real-time CVE data**: Fetches the latest vulnerability information from [CVEProject/cvelistV5](https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5)
- **Smart caching**: Results are cached locally for 24 hours to improve performance
- **Device-specific searches**: Automatically searches for CVEs related to detected camera brands (Hikvision, Dahua, Axis, etc.)
- **Structured CVE data**: Parses official CVE JSON format for accurate vulnerability information

### Camera Information
Each discovered camera is logged with:
- IP address and port
- Protocol type (RTSP, HTTP, etc.)
- Device manufacturer (when detectable)
- Credentials used (if any)
- AI analysis results (IR detection, motion areas, brightness)

### Command Line Options
```bash
sudo ./camsniff.sh [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -y, --yes     Skip confirmation prompts
  -q, --quiet   Reduce output verbosity
  -a, --auto    Full automation mode (skip all prompts)
  -t, --target  Specify target subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
  -h, --help    Show this help message
```

---

## Configuration

CamSniff uses `camcfg.json` for scanning parameters. Example:

```json
{
  "sleep_seconds": 45,
  "nmap_ports": "1-65535",
  "masscan_rate": 20000,
  "hydra_rate": 16,
  "max_streams": 4,
  "cve_github_repo": "https://api.github.com/repos/CVEProject/cvelistV5/contents/cves",
  "cve_cache_dir": "/tmp/cve_cache",
  "cve_current_year": "2025",
  "dynamic_rtsp_url": "https://github.com/CamioCam/rtsp/blob/master/cameras/paths.csv",
  "dirb_wordlist": "/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt",
  "snmp_communities": ["public", "private", "camera", "admin"],
  "medusa_threads": 8
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Dependencies:**  
  The tool will try to auto-install missing dependencies. Run as root (`sudo`) to allow installations.

- **RTSP Paths Not Found:**  
  Ensure `dynamic_rtsp_url` in `camcfg.json` points to a valid RTSP paths CSV.

- **Permission Issues:**  
  Always run as root to ensure necessary permissions for network scanning and dependency installation.

- **Network Issues:**  
  If you encounter network-related issues, ensure that your network connection is stable. You can also try restarting your network interface or router.

- **Error Messages:**  
  If you receive error messages during the scanning process, check the logs for detailed information. The logs are stored in `.log` files in the current directory.
